Welcome to PyStar!
=========================================================

The PyStar program is a workshop designed to teach all women (including trans women) and their friends who are 
looking to learn how to program in a friendly non-alpha-geek environment.  The material on this site
originally incorporated material developed by the |link1|, which 
was held March 4/5, 2011. Currently events decide and develop their own curriculum and badges using a mix
of what's on this site and their own preferences.  As this project continues hopefully this site will 
keep having more teaching materials added for a variety of skill levels.
