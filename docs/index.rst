Welcome to PyStar!
=========================================================

The PyStar program is a workshop designed to teach all women (including trans women) and their friends who are 
looking to learn how to program in a friendly non-alpha-geek environment.  The material on this site
originally incorporated material developed by the `Boston Python Workshop <https://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_workshop>`_ which 
was held March 4/5, 2011. Currently events decide and develop their own curriculum and badges using a mix
of what's on this site and their own preferences.  As this project continues hopefully this site will 
keep having more teaching materials added for a variety of skill levels.

If you would like to hold a PyStar workshop in your area using this material, please get in touch by
joining our `google group <http://groups.google.com/group/pystar>`_. Also if you have organized an event 
and have material you'd like to submit to help other organizers please fork `the repo <https://github.com/pystar/pystar>`_ and do a pull request or ask to become a collaborator via the google group.
